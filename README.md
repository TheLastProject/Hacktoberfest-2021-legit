# List of legitimate Hacktoberfest 2021 repos

Sadly, there are a lot of spam repositories, to the point that people are finding a hard time to find legitimate projects to contribute to.

This repository exists to list legitimate projects. Please add your own legitimate projects using a Pull Requests and we will review if it seems legitimate.

Contributions to this repository will NOT count towards your Hacktoberfest count, because that would be too easy.

Please add new repos in their programming language and keep it alphabetical. [Click here to add your project](https://github.com/TheLastProject/Hacktoberfest-2021-legit/edit/main/README.md).
