# List of legitimate Hacktoberfest 2021 repos

Sadly, there are a lot of spam repositories, to the point that people are finding a hard time to find legitimate projects to contribute to.

This repository exists to list legitimate projects. Please add your own legitimate projects using a Pull Requests and we will review if it seems legitimate.

Contributions to this repository will NOT count towards your Hacktoberfest count, because that would be too easy.
